AI as a Teaching Assistant:
AI was utilized as an assistant in learning new concepts or tutorials. It provided guidance on writing specific lines of code or understanding the functionality of certain functions.

Benefits and Costs:
AI played a supportive role in the learning process, aiding in the comprehension of coding concepts. However, there was a need for critical evaluation to ensure a complete understanding of the material.

#### Answering a Question in Class or in Discord:
Limited Discord Use:
Due to limited engagement with Discord, AI was not extensively used for answering questions in that platform.

Benefits and Costs:
While AI could have potentially provided assistance on Discord, my choice to engage less with the platform meant relying on other sources for information.

#### Asking or Answering a Smart Question:

AI was frequently used to check the framing of smart questions and provided answers to inquiries.

Benefits and Costs:
AI assisted in ensuring the clarity of questions, enhancing communication. However, careful consideration was required to validate the accuracy and relevance of the provided answers.

#### Coding Example e.g. “Give an example of using Underscore .pluck”:

AI, especially ChatGPT, was employed to generate examples of specific code blocks, such as using Underscore .pluck.

Benefits and Costs:
AI facilitated quick access to code examples, aiding in understanding and application. However, a critical evaluation of the generated code was necessary to ensure accuracy and relevance.

#### Explaining Code:

AI was utilized to assist in explaining the functionality of code segments.

Benefits and Costs:
The use of AI streamlined the process of code explanation. However, careful scrutiny was required to ensure that the explanations were accurate and aligned with the intended understanding.

#### Writing Code:

AI, particularly ChatGPT, provided basic skeletons for programs, enhancing organizational efficiency.

Benefits and Costs:
AI support in generating initial code structures expedited the coding process. However, customization and verification were necessary to align the generated code with specific project requirements.

#### Documenting Code:

In the case of the Functional Programming WOD, AI was used to generate a function using Underscore based on given instructions.

Benefits and Costs:
AI streamlined the documentation process for specific WODs, offering a starting point for further elaboration. However, careful review and customization were essential to meet the specific requirements of the WOD.

#### Quality Assurance:

Rather than relying on AI for quality assurance, I opted for manual code inspection, searching for issues independently.

Benefits and Costs:
The decision to inspect code manually aimed to deepen understanding. While it required more personal effort, this approach was considered beneficial for gaining a comprehensive grasp of code intricacies.

#### Other Uses in ICS 314 not Listed: I mainly focused my application of AI within the specified course elements.
