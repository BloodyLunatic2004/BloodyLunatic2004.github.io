## Overview
Finding and learning about available student clubs at UH Manoa is a difficult task that the UHM Clubhouse intends to solve. The UHM Clubhouse is an application for students to browse an organized directory of all current student clubs with brief descriptions, meeting information, and contact information.

## Personal Thoughts
My contributions to the project were the creation of the feedback form and the admin page, as well as the fixing of some errors and styles of the login and signup pages. I honestly had fun working on this project with my team. A good chunk of my time was spent experimenting on different styles for the pages, and trying new lines of code to see what would look best for the page. Working together in a group was also a fun challenge, as I usually have to do things myself and having peers to collaborate with on the project was a refreshing change of pace.
