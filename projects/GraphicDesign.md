summary: "A robot made out of Lego."
---

Back when I was in high school, I created my very own robot using cardboard and Lego pieces. This robot is capable of driving around, and it has a claw mounted on the top of the robot which can swing down to hit objects in front of it.

I designed the pieces of the robot's cardboard exterior in Autodesk Fusion 360, and printed them out using a laser cutter. I hand crafted the mechanisms used for the robot's functions out of Legos, and coded the functions in the Lego Mindstorms NXT app.

Despite the robot's simplicity, it holds a special place in my heart as this was my first real step into designing and creating a robot. I still have the robot to this day.
