summary: "A 2d fighting game."
---

This game was made in JavaScript and HTML5. It's a very simple game where the player controls a blue rectangle, and they must shoot projectiles at an orange rectangle to kill him. 

The player has a small projectile that does minimal damage but can be fired from a distance, and a large projectile that is more powerful but requires the player to get close to the enemy.
The enemy has a charge attack that they use occasionally, adding a risk-reward system to using the short range projectile. Choose to keep distance and spend longer taking down the enemy, or get up close and deal massive damage at the risk of being charged.

It's very bare-bones and has a few glitches, but it has its charms.
